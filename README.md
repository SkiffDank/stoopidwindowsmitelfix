stupid mitel crash fix click is this batch file

mitel has released a terrible excuse for a phone
their softphone only runs on windows
their softphone barely functions
their softphone should never have left stage 2 beta in this state let alone been released/SOLD
I use a deskphone in order to not have to deal with this crap
If you're stuck with a mitel softphone this will save you the clicks of finding folders with cache that needs deleted in order to go back to it's nominal barely-functional state.
